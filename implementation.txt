-Open Windows Explorer.
-Right click on This PC and select Properties.
-Click Advanced system settings.

-Add the JRE_HOME variable. Its value is the path to the JRE base directory. It will be -something like: C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_131. It differs per install. Use Windows -Explorer to browse and find the actual JRE base directory on your machine.
